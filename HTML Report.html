            Investigation and Plan
          </h2>
          <p>
            Smart home is one of the buzzwords of 2022, but what exactly does it mean? In a nutshell, a smart home means a home where certain items are connected to the Internet, otherwise known as Internet of Things (IoT) devices. This could be everything from light bulbs that you can turn on with your voice to smart security cameras that let you live to stream your footage from a mobile application</p>
<p>I researched many other options including a doorbell with camera and microphone functionality. I researched the company Ring and its products to emulate their smart home systems, however, due to technological limitations I couldn’t make this first idea a reality. Since I was interested in motion sensing and security, I shifted my idea to an in-home motion sensor with no camera or microphone functionality.</p>

 <p>Since my focus was shifted, I researched other companies that did motion sensor technology. I took inspiration from Bosch smart home motion sensor equipment however their product is obviously on a much larger scale and much more advanced like with different voltage etc. I decided to keep the same sort of theme alive and have 1 micro bit alerting the user that the other micro bit had detected motion. It would use a PIR motion sensor to detect the motion and play a sound and display a message when the other micro bit received the alert.</p> 

<p>It will be able to detect intruders in the home and alert the user of their presence. My artefact would solve the problem of in-home security and do it using the internet and communicate using radio. This ensures the alert can be received anywhere even if the user is somehow in a place with no internet or cellular connection.</p>

          <p>The users of the artefact would most likely be homeowners or any persons wishing to have increased security on a specific property. There are of course some ethical implications if an end-user were to place their motion device on someone else’s property to know if or when they left their house, however, I feel this will be an unlikely scenario and will only happen with a very small minority of users. Besides that, there are no social or ethical implications with the production or coding of the artefact.</p>

<p>However, due to technical limitations in the later stages of the project in all my iterations of the motion sensor, it didn’t work. It was coded well and was vigorously checked meaning it must be a hardware fault. So, I shifted my idea completely from Security to a mechanical greenhouse arrangement. This artefact solves a very specific problem for users who own greenhouses or conservatories. It automatically cools down the greenhouse or specified area using a water pump. It lessens the workload for the user while still completing the job.

            Design
          </h2>
          <p>
            In the designing of the artefact, I needed to focus my design to make sure it solved the problem it set about to solve. Improve moisture levels and alert the user of too great or too low moisture levels. I created this flowchart to focus my artefact to make sure it’s hitting all the right goals. In the testing and implementation phase I had made sure it had hit all these markers and followed this flowchart</p>

          <p>In the design of the artefact,  I needed to make sure it satisfied the requirements set about in the brief. The embedded system of the artefact uses two micro bits. One is connected to thing speak to track the moisture level of the soil which can also be seen in the profile page of the HTML website. It is put in the soil in the greenhouse and sends a signal via radio to the other micro bit. The second micro bit is in the user’s possession and sends a light signal that the soil has low moisture or is “too hot”. It is an indicator to tell the user it is pumping water into the soil. </p>
          <p>Micro bit one uses an IoT bit, a water pump, a relay and a moisture senor all connected to the original micro-bit and IoT bit.</p>

          <p>(For the preliminary testing it was powered by a computer to connect it to the internet). Above is a picture of the micro bit connected to the IoT bit. On the right is a relay that’s connected to the IoT bit and the micro bit. (More detailed diagrams will be later). </p>

          <p>Above is a picture of the water pump and moisture sensor both are connected to the micro bit connected to the IoT bit. </p>
          <p>The overall architecture of the artefact is flexible as all it needs is the IoT bit in the soil and the other micro bit on the user’s person. The moisture sensor is put in the ground with the water pump and micro bit connected to the IoT bit nearby.</p>
          <p>The HTML page uses the a validation check in the way of a password system to “log in” to the profile page to see the thing speak and see the graph of the heat or moisture of the greenhouse or soil.</p>

            Implementation and testing
          </h2>
          <h7>First Iteration</h7>
          <p>
           . I had to test how the artefact would function and if there were any problems with the artefact itself. This is where problems began to arise. Originally the idea for my artefact consisted of a security system with a PIR motion sensor that communicated to the other micro bit to tell the user that it detects movement in a room or specified area. I had the code written the micro bit wired and half the report written however when I went to test the micro bit on the 16th of January 2022 it didn’t work. I remade the code from scratch I tested it again still no response. I readjusted the sensor and tried everything, and it wouldn’t work.
          </p>
          <img src="https://cdn.glitch.global/ac84824f-42ed-4486-a0f9-17ebf95cc140/7bd997c0-3301-43b6-b3a8-5f14ba8e7862.image.png?v=1648585911823" width="350">
          <p>
           As I have no engineering background the only logical explanation is that the PIR sensor itself was broken to some extent as the code was solid and the wiring was also solid. Due to this setback so close to the deadline I had to go with my second and easier idea a mechanical greenhouse arrangement. 
          </p>
          <h6>Final Iteration</h6>
          <p>
           The mechanical greenhouse arrangement was the contingency plan in case the motion sensor didn’t work. The code itself wasn’t complicated just the coding of the pins and the construction of the artefact. The artefact consisted of two micro bits. One acting as the receiver and one acting as the transmitter. One would sense that the soil has low moisture or is “too hot” and send a radio signal to the other micro bit telling it that it is too hot with lights varying from red to green. The transmitter micro bit will then pump water into the soil to “cool it down” and increase moisture levels.
          </p>
          <p>
           Due to the rapid change in the artefact, the entire development process was done on the dates of the 16th of January – 20th of January. The coding, construction, testing, implementation, and the report was done between these dates. The HTML project was already completed beforehand. 
          </p>
          <p>
           On the 16th of January, the mechanical greenhouse arrangement was started and completed. A shortage of micro bits and other instrumental parts of the artefact was of short supply which contributed to the conservative design. The transmitter is connected to the IoT bit to connect the micro bit and sensors to thing speak so the data and be tracked and put on the HTML website. The IoT bit is connected to a relay, a moisture sensor, and a water pump.
          </p>
          <p>
           In initial testing the artefact failed to function as one of the pins in the relay was broken and a new relay had to be obtained. Another oversight from me was the numbering of the pins in the code. I forgot to change the numbers on the corresponding pins on the IoT bit and the receiver in the code. This also stopped the transmitter from working. The last mistake made was the relay and moisture sensor were put into the wrong pins resulting in no water being pumped as it was receiving no signal. The IoT bit is connected to a laptop or computer and communicates with the receiver via radio signal.
          </p>
          <img src="https://cdn.glitch.global/ac84824f-42ed-4486-a0f9-17ebf95cc140/d2d41efb-d5cb-46b2-976e-edca9a8c30d2.image.png?v=1648584526887" width="500">
          <p>
           The receiver had very few problems in comparison as the code and construction is a lot less advanced compared to the transmitter. The code issue was the only real issue with the receiver in preliminary testing. However, I decided to add a near traffic light ESC design to easily display to the user that there isn’t enough moisture in the soil or rather it is “too hot”. It goes from red to green and displays with colour coordination the moisture level in the soil. The receiver is connected to these lights with 5 crocodile clips, three for the colours, one for grounding and one for power. Red indicates the soil is low on moisture and temperature is too hot, yellow indicates that the soil is too cold and too high on moisture and green indicates that the temperature and moisture of the soil are perfect.
          </p>
          <p>
           As the code is measuring for temperature instead of moisture it is displayed using terms for temperature on the receiver. The receiver is also plugged into a laptop or computer however it can be powered using a battery pack plugged straight into the micro bit.
